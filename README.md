### stm32h7_bootload_app Introdunction

- The LED 0 blinks at 1hz for 5 seconds and the system waits for update message. If no single byte is received from FDTI chip (USART1), it looks to the memory location at 0x0802_0000. If the data is 0xFFFFFFFF (erased value) at the location, the system halts in a while loop and LED 1 turns on, else it starts excuting code from  that location.

- if a byte is received, it loops in a program state machine until it receives program done ID frame from serial port application. 

- on board CH340 driver does not work with Linux serial port so I change USART1 pins to PB6 PB7 and use FDTI chip to talk to /dev/ttyUSB0

- This program only takes bin size smaller than 128k (a sector for STM32H743). Update size does not have to be aligned to a flash word (256bits), software will auto-fill up with 0xFFif not aligned. Max PAYLOAD of update byte is 256 bytes per frame

- versioning are MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH. each is represented by 1 byte decimal value (0 ~ 255)
 e.g. v2.0.23 (update_info.version[0]=0x02, update_info.version[1]=0x00, update_info.version[2]=0x17)

- Now the program only erases and updates Bank 1 Sector 1 (0x802_0000), it needs further improvemnet for flexible sector update.
